We (nautilus) respect your privacy and don't want to be creepy, so here's the deal:

1. We don't collect or store any personal information about you or your Discord account. Like, at all.
2. We don't log any conversations or interactions you have with the bot. Your secrets are safe with us.
3. We don't use cookies or any other tracking tech to monitor your online activity. You're free to browse without being tracked.
4. We don't share any information about you with third-party services or companies. You're not a product, bro.
5. We don't keep any data about your interactions with the bot. Once you're done, it's gone, poof!

By using the Interact bot, you acknowledge that you've read and understood this privacy policy. We're committed to keeping your info private, 'cause that's just how we roll.

Note: This policy may change in the future, but we'll let you know if that happens."
